### :jack_o_lantern: **List of Supplies**
- [MudWatt Core Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GY5P06/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
- [LED](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/353) 5mm Yellow Flicker bulb
- Jar that is about 5 inch tall and at least 4 inches wide
- Piece of scrap paper
- Paper towel holder
- 7 Inch tall Pumpkin
- Knife for pumpkin cutting
- Spoon for pumpkin innard removal
- Scotch Tape
- Scissors
- Water
- Dirt (not potting soil)

Note: The ["Core"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LJX8C8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) MudWatt kit is $29.99 and does not come with a jar. The ["Classic"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GY5P06/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) kit is $39.99 and comes with jar.

## :jack_o_lantern: **Steps**
1. Gather a few hand fulls of soil, make mud
2. Add mud, wired anode, mud, and wired cathode to glass jar using the [Magical Microbes Guide](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Microbial-Fuel-Cell-MFC-Using-Mud/)
3. Add capacitor, wires, and 5mm [flickering yellow LED](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/353) to board in pins 5 and 6
4. Create paper tea light housing by cutting cardboard roll 2 inches, wrapping in scrap paper, and taping a cut paper circle on top of cylinder
5. Remove LED from board and punch it through the top of the "candle" body then reconnect
6. Carve pumpkin, with hole in bottom for candle
7. Place candle in pumpkin, sitting on dirt jar. Now you have a Jack-o-lantern powered by soil microbes!
