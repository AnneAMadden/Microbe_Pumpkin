# Microbe_Pumpkin
A Jack-o-lantern lit up with a soil microbe-powered tea light

Using some household supplies, a microbe-fuel cell kit, a pumpkin, and a supplemental LED bulb create a flickering Jack-o-lantern.

The electricity is produced by naturally occuring soil microorganisms (bacteria.) 

Most instructions for the microbial power source are contained in the Magic Microbes MuddWatt kit instructions. 

The project takes less than a few hours to complete, the microbes need to grow for a few days to create enough power to create a slow flashing LED. The flashing rate will increase with microbial activity. 

This energy source is renewable, relying on microbes that feed off of cardboard and other nutrients available in the soil. 

The safety concerns are around sharp knives, and putting wires into a circuit board, so with assistance this is fun for the whole family.

Warning: My cat tried to drink from the cathode and ate the first version of the paper roll tea light structure, so be forwarned.
